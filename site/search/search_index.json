Optics Calibration Due to the nature of 3D printing and assembly each headset is going to be slightly unique and will require going through a calibration process to display the image correctly.

Calibrate the lenses on your stereo cameras: Print out an OpenCV calibration chessboard, and affixing it to a flat backing board. Flatness is absolutely crucial for the calibration. Editing the config variables at the top of dualStereoChessboardCalibration.py with the correct: Number of interior corners on each axis Dimensions of each square on the checkerboard (in meters!) Install Python 3 on your machine and run pip install numpy and pip install opencv-contrib-python Run it from the python scripts folder, usually something like C:\\Users\\*USERNAME*\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\Scripts Running dualStereoChessboardCalibration.py First, ensure that your upper stereo camera appears on top in the camera visualizer If not, exit the program, and unplug/replug your cameras' USB ports in various orders/ports until they do. Hold your checkerboard in front of your camera array, ensuring to move it around to gain good coverage. Every time the calibrator takes a snapshot, it will print a notice in the terminal. After 30 snapshots in both camera views, it will run the calibration routines and display rectified views. If the calibration went well, you will see your live camera stream rectified such that all straight lines in the real world will appear straight in the camera image, and the images will look straightened and vertically aligned between the screens. If this happened, congratulations! Exit out of the program and run it one more time. Running it again verifies the calibration can be loaded AND GENERATES THE CALIBRATION JSON If the calibration did not go well (you see horrible warping and badness), you can attempt the calibration again by: Deleting the created dualCameraCalibration.npz AND cameraCalibration.json files from the main folder Trying again: ensuring the checkerboard is flat, the config parameters are correct, and that you have good coverage (including along depth) 3. Calibrate the Optical Assembly on your North Star You should have a good cameraCalibration.json file in the main folder (from the last step) Ensure that your main monitor is 1920x1080 is and the Calibration Monitor appears to the left of the main monitor, and the north star display appears to the right of it. This ensures that the automatic layouting algorithm detects the various monitors appropriately. Edit config.json to have the active area for your calibration monitor you found earlier. Download this version of the Leap Service: https://github.com/leapmotion/UnityModules/tree/feat-multi-device/Multidevice%20Service The calibrator was built with this version; it will complain if you don't have it :/ Now Run the NorthStarCalibrator.exe You should see the top camera's images in the top right, and the bottom camera's images on the bottom. If this is not so, please reconnect your cameras until it is (same process as for the checkerboard script) You should also see a set of sliders and buttons running along the top. These control the calibration process. First, point the bare calibration rig toward the calibration monitor Ensure it is roughly centered on the monitor, so it can see all of the vertical area. Then Press \"1) Align Monitor Transform\" This will attempt to localize the monitor in space relative to the calibration rig. This is important for the later steps. Next, place the headset onto the calibration rig and press \"2) Create Reflector Mask\" This should mask out all of the camera's FoV except the region where the screen and reflectors overlap the calibration monitor. If it does not appear to do this, double check that all of the prior steps have been followed correctly... Now, before we press \"3) Toggle Optimization\", we'll want to adjust the bottom two sliders until the both represent roughly equal brightnesses. This is important since the optimizer is trying to create a configuration that yields a perfectly gray viewing area. Now press \"3) Toggle Optimization\" and observe it.

Since then there have been multiple revisions to make the headset stronger, easier to print, and more comfortable. For a detailed writeup of the changes made in release 3, check out the Release 3 Documentation . What connection does the leap motion controller use? My kit only came with a usb micro-b cable? The leap motion was designed to be able to support usb 3.0, however it currently only utilizes usb 2.0. This means you can use a standard usb micro-b connection with the sensor, which is useful for integrating it into smaller form factors, like an hmd. Will the optics bracket fit on the Ender 3 Printer? Yes! The optics bracket will fit, you may have to rotate it a bit to fit properly on the build plate, here's a screenshot for reference.

Check the sidebar to jump to the correct question. What are the differences between the kits? Which should I get? Smart Prototyping offers multiple kits. Kit A contains all the electronics and mechanical pieces to get you started with your build, but does NOT come with 3D printed parts. You'll have to print them, and assemble the headset. Kit B contains all the electronics and mechanical parts, along with the 3D printed parts. You'll still need to assemble and calibrate the headset. Kit C contains the headset fully assembled and pre-calibrated. You can also choose which set of cables you'd like with your headset on the checkout page, or order extra parts or upgrade kits as the project continues development. What kind of screws are in the kit? What tools do I need for assembly (what is included in the kit and what is not for putting everything together)? The smart prototyping kits come with a full screwdriver kit, and all the screws you'll need to build the headset, aside from a soldering iron. A soldering iron is used for heating up the heat-threaded inserts and can be found at any local electronics store for around $10 USD. What is the difference between the 25cm and 75cm version of the headset? These numbers refer to the focal distance that the images appear from the user. The only difference between the two is the location of the screens relative to the combiner. The focal distances can be switched by replacing the display tray. Typically, we recommend starting with a 25cm build since they are easier to get started with. Kit B ships with both 25cm and 75cm trays so you can choose which method you want when you build your headset. Kit C , the preassembled version requires you to choose which version you want before ordering as these headset are pre-calibrated. ****25cm is sharper for items attached to your hand or right in front of your face. 25cm provides a much better experience when using all the virtual wearable interfaces from Leap Motion 25cm allows for a slightly wider FOV 25cm is also much brighter because of the angle of incidence and collimation layer in the display panel for wandering about and batting stuff around, throwing things, sticking stuff to your wall, or making Characters run around the room 75cm is way more convincing. With 25cm, the Vergence accommodation effect is noticeable, even if you get your IPD just right 75 cm is harder to calibrate than 25cm In general, 75 cm is better if a lot of things you\u2019re dealing with are further away, while 25 cm is best if you\u2019re prototyping hand interactions. You can still tell how far away things are with either of the focal distances via stereo overall. So to conclude, whichever decision you opt for will work depending on what you plan on doing. However, something to keep in mind is that if you wish to switch between the two display holders, you have to put the screens into the new trays and recalibrate the headset using the stand. If I already have a calibration JSON file for my headset, can I not simply reuse that in the event that I reprint the display trays / change them from 25 cm to 75 cm or vice versa? Just switching or reusing past calibration JSONs isn\u2019t enough. Simply knocking a set of combiners in an optics bracket into a different position by a fraction of a mm is enough to invalidate the calibration. The same goes for repositioning, or removing and reinserting the display in the same tray. Displays and combiners cannot move relative to each other without needing recalibration. There\u2019s also a lot of imprecision in FDM printing and hand assembly. The positioning of the headset inserts in the back of the trays is, alone, imprecise enough that most headsets are imperfect by nature for the level of quality that is required for this project if you want the best experience that North Star is capable of producing. My displays have arrived but the connector ribbon is strongly attached to the back. Do I peel it off before inserting it into the screen holder? What about the small circuit boards attached to it? Do they come off with the ribbon cable or do they stay attached to the ribbon cable? Currently you have to peel the cable * carefully and patiently * from the back of the display. A detailed and descriptive video is available here, elaborating on how to carefully handle this item here: https://youtu.be/YsGSf7lwdCs How do I insert the displays into the display tray and attach the unit to the headset? Make sure you DO NOT force the screen inside the screen holder under any circumstance. The screen holder has a tray that goes all around which will allow the screen to slide in smoothly. The screen is very sensitive and damage to it is in many cases irreparable and will require a re-order of a new component. What are the cables connecting to the display driver board? There are a total of four cables connecting to the board (see picture below): - two are the two ribbon cables that send data and power to the two displays. The connections are on either side of the board one for power one for the mini display port (for transferring data) Warning Note that the board will only work with display port connections that support 4k@60hz, hdmi -> displayport adapters will not work. usb-c with displayport functionality or displayport to mini-displayport adapters work fine, as long as they support 4k@60hz. Warning NOTE: IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU CONNECT THE POWER in the right direction as per the image shown below or irreparable damage might occur to the board. The expected behavior for the board having adequate power and working properly is having yellow led turned on. The LED's location has also been labeled in the image attached above. If there is also a red led lighting up upon plugging it in, this is reflective of insufficient power being fed into the board. If you have a voltmeter handy you might be interested in checking if after plugging the USB into a computer or a wall socket to usb converter that the voltmeter shows 5V of potential. This is the expected output for a USB connection. If the output voltage is correct or if you see no led light lighting whatsoever then there must be an issue with the device driver board. If this is the case reach out in the #noa-labs-display-adapter channel on the discord server for help in debugging. Secondly, if you do see the board led lighting up but don\u2019t see anything on the screen you can do a couple of things to get things going: Plugging the power USB in the same computer where you are plugging your display adapter makes things sync up (as this common source shares the same ground) Disconnect everything and connect things in the following order: displays first (make sure you align the pins correctly and don\u2019t force push the cables into the board as that might damage the pins), connect the power cable into your laptop and finally the display adapter. DO NOT under any circumstance unplug the display cables directly from the board while power is being connected. Also, always opt for operating with the cables that connect to the computer Note There is a reset button. Using it is actually much safer than plugging cables in and out during testing.","title":"Smart Prototyping Kits"},{"location":"mechanical/smart-prototyping-kits/#faq-smart-prototyping-kits","text":"Note This page is intended to be specifically about the Smart Prototyping kits, there will be some overlap with general FAQ.

Overview The headset is made up of three modular assemblies: the optics bracket, the headgear with hinges, and the halo (which contains all the electronics). This configuration has been very useful as we iterated on different parts. The parts are 3D printed using consumer grade 3D printers and materials, with a couple parts from McMaster-Carr . The goal is to have an easily reproduced AR headset that anyone can put together. Ignoring the reflectors, you'll need to 3D print roughly 20+ hours of parts and cut, drill and tap aluminum bar stock. Nothing expensive or major requiring a machine shop, but a few tools are expected. Read below for the list. Note We are exploring different possibilities for individuals to obtain reflectors.

One property of elipsoids is that all the light emitted from one focus reflects off its surface and focuses it to the second focus! Amazing. Therefore, to figure out the section of elipsoid needed in our AR application, we traced a ray backwards from the second focus, through a cellphone-sized. The resultant elipsoid is defined by the following dimensions, chosen to allow a range of 3-to-5-inch LCD panels to be placed near the eye. The perimeter of the elipsoid section was decided on empirically by minimizing distortion with a larger prototype, then cropping to the reflected image. This large reflector was roughly 120x120mm, and the final ended up being around 75x75mm. The reflectors are diamond-turned and milled from PMMA (a.k.a. acrylic). The outside surface needs an anti-reflective coating to prevent a secondary reflection from degrading the image. Indoors and subjectively, 50-50% (transmissive-reflective) anti-reflective coating provided the best results for us. From the elipsoid definition, the reflectors need to be rotated and translated into position. We define the origin point as the midpoint between the two reflector foci, which should line up with the user's pupils: E: OEM Headgear replacement Light and adjustable with rigid mount points. Several welder's mask headgear vendors were tested, but most failed to be rigid or comfortable for our applications. Their general design is made of injection-molded plastic features that tighten onto either side of a welding faceshield. Although it may be desireable for those features to be flexible and compliant for welding, our heavier AR assemblies caused the headgear to flex and/or dig into the users' head. Ouch. The following Miller branded model's had very little flex and generally comfortable. It really helps they're lightweight as well. These two specific generations of headgears yielded the best results quickly, mounting evolving electronics on the most varied heads. The amount of adjustment points makes it work for the large majority of users.

At the time, the optics would bounce around, causing the reflected image to shake wildly as we moved around. We minimized this by switching to the stiffer Miller headgear and continued other improvements for several months. However, the 3M headgear was sorely missed, as it was simple to put-on and less intimidating for demos. Since then we added cheek alignment features, which solved the image bounce, and therefore makes sense to bring back this design as a supplement to the release headgear. The headgear and optics are interchangeable, only the hinges need to match the headgear.

J: 3D Printed Parts Each component has suggested orientation and print settings for the best performance and least print time. Proceed to the 3D print section for information on each print: 3D Printing Part Reference Assembly Steps The NorthStar headset has three main sub-assemblies: the optics bracket, the electronics tray, and the adjustable headgear. Miller headgear (see below for alternate headgear with torsion hinge) 1) Verify the aluminum bar stock slides without resistance inside the 3D printed hinges. Tip: Repeatedly sliding the bar stock quickly through a new hinge clears out any obtrusive burs, and the heat generated shapes the plastic. 2) Disassemble old hinges from headgear, set aside the o-rings: 3) Assemble new hinge as shown below, using screw/nut H . Tighten until the o-ring is still visible and the hinge has considerable resistance turning. 4) Slide hinge onto headgear, aligning with front of track. Lock in place using screw F Alternate: 3M Speedglas headgear 1) Remove the mounting assemblies on both sides of the headgear, enlarge hole to 18mm. We used a stepped drill to enlarge the hole, a little larger than the diameter of the spring we\u2019re using. 2) Place matching spring into rear housing, fasten close, and trim spring legs. 3) Place the outer hinge housing onto the spring, in the orientation shown. Using the perimeter fasteners, clamp down onto the spring leg, aligning it with the cutout. 4) Fasten the large center locknut and screw, adjusting it for the desired resistance. Trim the remaining spring leg. Electronics Tray 5) Fasten display driver B to 3D printed bracket using F screws x 3. Fasten hand tracking module A to 3D print using screws from its enclosure 6) Place USB cable into USB strain relief, and fasten using F screws x 2 to electronics tray 7) Adjust USB cable until the flex connector is aligned with connector and doesn't strain Optics Bracket 8) Fasten electronics tray to halo using 2 screws F 9) Fasten optics bracket to the halo using 6 screws F 10) Fasten displays and facial interfaces into optics bracket using 4 screws per side G (8 total). 11) Carefully connect the display flex connector to the driver board 12) Fasten lid to halo using 4 screws F from the bottom as shown 13) Secure wires to lid using cable-ties through the anchors 14) Verify reflectors align with tabs in optics bracket, scrape away offending plastic if not. Using hot-glue, \"tack\" the reflectors into the halo bracket. Be careful not to use too much and be quick enough that the glue doesn't solidify before the reflectors are in place. Final Assembly 15) Fasten slides to assembled optics bracket using 4 x G screws 16) Make adjustments for user's head.

Its principle objective is to be more inviting, less hacked together, and more reliable. The design includes more adjustments and mechanisms for a larger variety of heads and facial geometries. Overall, the assembly is lighter, more balanced, and stiffer. This is a work in progress. This is not a finished guide, nor end-user friendly. Major sections are missing. Assembly requires care and patience. Nothing worth having is ever easy. Getting Started Open the Headset Mechanical Assembly and construct each sub-assembly as illustrated. A full list of the parts needed can be found in the Headset Bill of Materials (BOM) . Not all sub-assemblies are required as there are multiple designs to choose from. Additionally, the CAD files are included in STEP format to help design new parts. Design Overview The headset consists of two basic sections: the optics #100-000 and headgear #200-000 . The optics subassembly currently has two variants: Release 3 optics and Update 3-1 (i.e. the simplified optics assembly). The headgear assembly utilizes the rear adjustment mechanism from a Miller branded welder\u2019s helmet, but several models can be made to work. Optics assembly: Release 3 vs 3-1 Functionally, the two optics assemblies are the same. Release 3 is closer to the original design aesthetic and it\u2019s marginally (8g) more lightweight. On the other hand, Update 3-1 halves the print time by removing the need for supports on the sides. Overall, the simplified 3-1 bracket is easier to print with lower print failures and stiffer too. It\u2019s recommended to start with the simplified Release 3-1 optics assembly for the first build. See drawing #100-000 for more information. Notes on 3D printed parts The parts were designed for a FDM style 3D printer All development was done using eSun's PLA Pro / PLA+ filament. We've found it to be strong, easy to print, and have great surface finish. A build plate of approximately 250x200mm is recommended for the largest parts Parts may need to be rotated to align with print bed. Some parts have optimized versions (labeled \u201cFDM OPTIMIZED\u201d) with extra plastic tabs that need removing. These versions aid in minimizing warping and gripping the print surface. {% hint style=\"info]() .25mm layer height, 2 perimeter shells, 15% infill Filament: eSun PLA Pro (PLA+) 3D Printer: MakerGear M2 Slicer: Simplify 3D {% endhint %} Installing heat set inserts Several parts in the optics assembly use brass inserts for increased clamping load and the ability to swap out the components multiple times without wear. These inserts need to be heated above the plastic's melting point and pressed into the plastic. It's recommended to use an installation tip designed for brass inserts. Installing inserts using soldering iron Demonstration of using a soldering iron to install brass inserts. The wire cutters are used to prevent the insert from pulling back out when not using an installation tip. Parts that require inserts: {% hint style=\"info]() Display trays (4 inserts each) - #111-00x and #112-00x Driver board mount (2 inserts) - #121-001 / #131-001 `` {% endhint %} Installing brass inserts into the optics bracket is optional. They're intended as mounting points for future testing. Bending thermoplastics The headgear assembly includes parts that print flat but bend to fasten to each other. Although not necessary, it\u2019s suggested to drape these parts around a form while the 3D print is still soft from the heated print bed. This minimizes strain inside the plastic and prolongs the life of the part. {% embed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDvcU_RxaM8\" caption=\"Example using mannequin head]() Preheating the print bed to 70C softens a print enough to shape the part","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"mechanical/leap-motion-r3/#northstar-release-3","text":"Mechanical Release 3 bundles together all the lessons we learned into a new set of 3D files and drawings.
